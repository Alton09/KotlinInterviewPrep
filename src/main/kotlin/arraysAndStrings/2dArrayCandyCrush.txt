Write a function that takes inputs h (height),  w (width), and an array of colors. It outputs a grid of colors that meets the following criteria:

1. Use the inputs: heigh and width of the grid. Only use colors from colors array. 
2. Non-deterministic: every time the method is executed with the same input, a different output must be produced.
3. No 3 consecutive colors: no row or column may contain 3 consecutive colors.
4. At least 1 starting move: swap two neighboring grid spaces to create 3 consecutive colors (row or column)

Example: - This is a valid starting grid

R  |  G  |  R  |  Y 
R  |  R  |  Y  |  Y
B  |  B  |  Y  |  P

There are two starting moves:
Swapping R and G will cause 3 Rs to be in consequtive order. 
Swapping P and Y will also cause 3 Ys to be in order.
